# Simple Dashboard 3D (React + TypeScript)

## Overview
This project implements the requested dashboard with 2 pages:
- **Designers**: list and add designers
- **Editor**: 3D canvas to add, select, move and edit objects attached to designers

The backend API is not accessible, so the project includes a **mock API layer** designed to be easily replaced with a real API later.
